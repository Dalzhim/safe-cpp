I've begun my work on documenting Safe C++. I'll keep adding to these pages over the next month.

Start [reading](intro.md).

Safe C++ is _incomplete_ at this time. Check the [roadmap](roadmap.md) for the work I'm doing.

I was a guest on CppCast: [CppCast: Safe, Borrow-Checked C++](https://cppcast.com/safe-borrow-checked-cpp/).

There's a Youtube recording of a Zoom demo I gave of Safe C++ to the public and ISO members: [Safe C++ Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q1awoAwBgQ).
